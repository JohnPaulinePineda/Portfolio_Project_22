This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_22/) explores the various clustering algorithms for segmenting information. Methods applied in the analysis to cluster high dimensional data included the K-Means, Partitioning Around Medoids, Fuzzy Analysis Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Agglomerative Nesting and Divisive Analysis Clustering algorithms. The different clustering algorithms were subjectively evaluated based on their capability to effectively capture the latent characteristics between the different resulting clusters. In addition, the values for the average silhouette width obtained for each algorithm were also assessed for an objective comparison of their clustering performance.
